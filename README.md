# Dad Joke Generator

### Description:

This website was made by following a tutorial by Dave Gray in which we build serverless functions with JavaScript and utilize continuous deployment with GitHub and Netlify. The result is a page that retrieves dad jokes from [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) and reloads every 10 seconds with a new one.
